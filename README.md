# l4rncpp
my journey with cpp;;
this was my day 5 with cpp, my learning curve is quite different, instead of going on with the old way, first learning all the basics, then more and more and getting stuck in the tutorial hell.
I decided to give only two days to understand the basic, well this way might not be the productive one, but it seems alright.
hope to keep up with this grind.
